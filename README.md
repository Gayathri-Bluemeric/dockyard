# dockyard
DockYard is an open source, docker management tool that can manage docker images and containers running on a Linux, Windows or Mac OS X. DockYard runs as a docker container and thus it is platform neutral. By integrating the docker hosts across these different environments in to a single management window, the teams can share images and containers.
